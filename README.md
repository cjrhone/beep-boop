## Description

_A simple website that takes a users number input and returns either beep, boop, or "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"
This website was created at Epicodus coding bootcamp as a week 3 independent project._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone or download the repository._
* _If downloaded, unzip the files into a single directory._
* _Right-click on the HTML file "index.html", then open it using a web browser._
* _Use Firefox or Chrome for best results, though IE shouldn't have any problems._

## Specs

    -Example Input: 0

    -Example Input: 3
